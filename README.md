### 🧙‍♂️ About Me

I'm a game dev who occasionally touches grass (it's a lie) and frequently touches code. `Work, work!`

From Unity to Unreal, I build worlds, games, environment, stories, break bugs and create bugs, actually create more than fix them. `Yes, milord? What is it?`

Also into web dev and UI/UX like a true full-stack Wacraft III peon. Something need doing? `Ready to work!`

(And maybe a little Warcraft universe fan) 😅

### 🧠 Fun Facts

- I think my own Graveyard is even bigger than Google Graveyard😆. Don't know if I should be proud of this😅
- I started coding at 11 with my brother whipping me when I was doing a mistake 😭
- I believe game UI should be both *pretty* and *make players cry* (of joy of course)😳
